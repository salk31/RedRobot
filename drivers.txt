WebDriver/Firefox
+ Real browser -> very actively developed
+ Lots of support
- Breaks on FF upgrade  (have known good binary?)
- 2 second hard wired delay for swithTo().alert()

WebDriver/HtmlUnit
- Can't do interactive alerts

HtmlUnit (direct)
- Slow
- No absolute positioning
+ Pure Java so only one runtime

PhantomJs (direct)
- Crashes?
- Wait for async read - ticket open
